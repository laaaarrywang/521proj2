# STA521 Project 2 Cloud Detection

Jointly completed by Linxuan Wang and Jingan Zhou.

The project is structured as follows:

(1) R folder: contains all .Rmd files utilized for analysis

(2) image_data folder: consists of three images as input data

(3) Report folder: contains the .tex file, all the output graphs used to generate the report

(4) STA521 Project 2.pdf: the final report

(5) README.md

Inside the R folder, .Rmd files are ordered by the order to execute. Namely, start from `0 readData.Rmd`, then `1 EDA.Rmd`, `2 Preparation.Rmd`, `2d CVmaster.Rmd`, `3 Modelling.Rmd`, and finally `4 Diagnostics.Rmd`.

If we have any new or updated dataset, we only need to modify the `0 readData.Rmd` file so that R would read the new corrected data.
